# Simple Ð¡ovid19 Tracker
This application allows you to determine the total number of cases of infection, the number of recoveries and deaths in the country or around the world.

The application is built on WPF technology.
The application consists of two parts. The first part is Covid19Tracker. She contains views and view models.

The second part is the Covid19TrackerLibrary. She contains a model. I used covid api.
